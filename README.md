# collaborative-whiteboard
Just a fun little collaborative whiteboard app for people who see my discord status.

# Technologies
I used web sockets, TypeScript, web canvases, and nodejs to build this.

And also this great color picker module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@simonwep/pickr

# Issues
Run into a bug? Create a github issue and I'll try to fix it
